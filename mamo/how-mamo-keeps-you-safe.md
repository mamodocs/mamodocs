# 🛡️ How Mamo Keeps You Safe

## **Your money, your control. Our promise.**

Simple on the surface, secure at the core. That's Mamo. While you focus on building wealth one habit at a time, we focus on keeping your money protected — with smart, human-first routines that put you in charge, always.

There are no confusing rules, just thoughtful security that works quietly in the background.

## 🛡️ Your money, always yours

Here's something different about Mamo: your money never leaves your hands.

When you deposit, your funds flow into a personal smart contract — think of it as your own secure vault, connected directly to your wallet. Only you hold the keys. Only you approve changes.

Mamo helps your money grow, but can't touch a single dollar without your say so. **You're in control, always.**

## 🔐 Security by design

We didn't just add security as an afterthought. It's woven into everything.

**Always accessible:** Your money doesn't depend on us being online. If Mamo ever goes down, you still have direct access to your full balance. No middlemen. No waiting. Just you and your funds.

**Independently verified:** Trust comes from proof, not promises. That's why Mamo has been independently audited by leading security firms, [**Certora**](https://www.certora.com/) and [**Halborn Security**](https://www.halborn.com/). We've also partnered with [**Code4rena**](https://code4rena.com/) for a bug bounty program, offering up to $250,000 for responsibly disclosed issues. Learn more at [**Audits**](audits.md).

**Nothing happens without you:** No silent updates. No surprise changes. Every adjustment needs your thumbs up first.

## 👀 Complete transparency

**You've got enough on your plate.** We keep things visible and simple.

* No hidden fees lurking in fine print
* No lockups keeping your money hostage
* No surprises disrupting your progress

Watch your portfolio grow in real-time. See every deposit, every earning, every move. Learn as you earn — without the spreadsheets.

## 🔄 Updates that respect your choice

When we build something better, you decide if you want it.

* Clear notifications when improvements are ready
* Only tested, trusted updates offered
* Nothing changes until you give the green light

Your financial companion evolves with your permission, not without it.

## 🔄 Smart protection for your earnings

When converting rewards back into your strategy (like turning earnings into more USDC), every step includes thoughtful safeguards:

**Fair-value trades:** We set smart limits. If prices swing too far, we wait for better conditions. No rushed decisions, just calm, steady progress.

**Trusted partners:** Using tools like CowSwap and Chainlink means your trades are protected from manipulation and verified for fairness. Complex tech, simple outcome — you get what you deserve.

## ⚖️ Honest about risk

All investing carries risk. We believe in being upfront about it.

* You choose how much to deposit
* You can withdraw whenever you need
* You get clear information, not finance speak

Mamo is built for steady wins, not wild rides. A system designed for the many, not the few.
