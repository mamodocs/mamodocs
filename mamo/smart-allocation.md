## **Smart Allocation: Your Money, Always in the Right Place**

Mamo watches two places where your USDC can earn: [**Moonwell**](https://moonwell.fi/)'s [**USDC Core Market**](https://moonwell.fi/markets/supply/base/usdc) and [**USDC Flagship Vault**](https://moonwell.fi/vaults/deposit/base/mwusdc). Interest rates shift constantly based on supply and demand. Instead of you tracking these changes, Mamo handles the moves for you.

When the Core Market offers better returns, your USDC stays there. When the Vault becomes more attractive, Mamo shifts your funds over. This happens automatically â€” no manual steps, no waiting for you to log in and make decisions.

**You're in control, always.** You can see where your funds are earning and add, pause, or withdraw anytime. No lockups. No confusing rules. Just a system that works with you.

Think of it as having a financial companion that never sleeps. While you're focused on everything else in your life, Mamo is quietly making sure your USDC is earning the best rate available. You've got enough on your plate â€” this is one less thing to manage.

Your Mamo dashboard shows your account balance and earnings. The technical details of which market you're in right now? That's handled in the background. You'll grow smarter about how these markets work simply by watching your returns over time.

This isn't about chasing pumps or timing markets. It's about steady, smart growth. One habit at a time. Your money works harder so you don't have to.
