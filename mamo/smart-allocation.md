# 🤖 Smart Allocation

One of Mamo’s greatest strengths is its ability to **automatically shift your funds** between Moonwell’s [**USDC Core Market**](https://moonwell.fi/markets/supply/base/usdc) and [**USDC Flagship Vault**](https://moonwell.fi/vaults/deposit/base/mwusdc) to always get the best interest rate available. Interest rates in these markets can change at any time – they’re variable, depending on how much is borrowed vs the amount lent out on the respective platforms. It might sound daunting to keep up with these changes, but that’s exactly what Mamo handles for you, 24/7.

Think of Mamo as a diligent gardener tending two plots: one plot is the **Moonwell USDC Core Market**, the other is the **Moonwell USDC Flagship Vault.** Mamo constantly checks which plot has the richest “soil” (the higher yield) at any given time. If the core market is offering a better rate, Mamo will keep your USDC there. If the vault starts earning more, Mamo will **swiftly move your USDC into the vault** to take advantage. This process is often referred to as **dynamic fund allocation** – and it’s all done by smart contracts and logic that Mamo runs automatically. Your funds flow to wherever the returns are highest, within a set of safe parameters.

The key point here is you **do not** need to manually intervene. You don’t have to watch interest rate charts or move assets around yourself. Mamo acts like your personal portfolio manager, making those decisions in real-time on your behalf. This means even if you’re asleep or offline, Mamo might reallocate your USDC at 3 AM because, say, the Moonwell Flagship USDC Vault became more attractive suddenly. By doing this, Mamo ensures you’re **always earning the optimal rate** available, without any downtime. It’s a bit like having an expert watching the market for you and shifting your savings to the account with the best interest rate without you even noticing.

And don’t worry – when Mamo moves funds, it’s all done through secure smart contract operations. There are no extra hoops for you to jump through. In your Mamo dashboard (or account view), you’ll simply see that you’re invested through Mamo and earning yield; the technical details of whether it’s in Moonwell or Morpho at the moment are abstracted away. The result is a **smooth experience** where your USDC is always in the right place at the right time. This hands-free optimization is central to how Mamo talks to its users: with simplicity and encouragement, letting you know _“we’ve got you covered, you don’t need to manage anything yourself”_.

**Mamo is always on duty**, watching the market like a hawk so you don’t have to. You can set it, forget it, and trust that Mamo is continuously working to get you the best returns available, all while keeping your funds safe and your experience simple.
