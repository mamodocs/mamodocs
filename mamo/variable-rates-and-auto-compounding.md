# ðŸ“ˆ Variable Rates and Auto-Compounding

## **Your rates will move. Thatâ€™s how it should be.**

The returns you earn with Mamo are **variable** â€” your annual percentage yield (APY) shifts with market conditions. One day it might be 10%, another it could be 8% or 12%. You've got enough on your plate without worrying about chasing rates across different platforms.

While the number changes, **Mamo ensures you're always earning the best rate available.** Mamo quietly monitors the top lending opportunities across [**Moonwell**](https://moonwell.fi/) and [**Morpho**](https://morpho.org/), moving your funds to wherever they'll work hardest. No spreadsheets or manual tracking. You stay in control, always.

Your earnings reflect real economic activity. When more people want to borrow USDC for trading or liquidity needs, lenders receive a higher return. When there's plenty of USDC available and fewer borrowers, rates adjust down. It's simple **supply and demand**, the same forces that drive all healthy markets. What stays constant? Mamo working in the background to ensure your funds are always in the right place at the right time.

### **Compounding for everyone, automatically.**

Interest you earn gets automatically added to your balance. More USDC earning interest means more interest next time around. It's one of the most powerful wealth-building habits available, and it happens quietly while you focus on everything else in your life.&#x20;

When your balance earns $10 today, that $10 gets added to your principal. Tomorrow, you're earning interest on your original amount plus that extra $10. It's your money making money, which makes even more money. Steady wins.

When Mamo collects at least $5 worth of rewards (additional tokens from lending platforms, for example WELL or MORPHO tokens), we convert them to USDC and add them to your balance. No manual claiming. No separate reward tokens to track. It just works in the background.

Over weeks and months, this quiet growth creates meaningful acceleration. One habit at a time, building wealth that compounds.

{% hint style="info" %}
A $1,000 balance earning 10% annually becomes $1,100 after one year with simple interest. With daily compounding, it becomes $1,105. That extra $5 might seem small, but scale it up across larger balances and longer timeframes, and you see how small, consistent actions create substantial results.
