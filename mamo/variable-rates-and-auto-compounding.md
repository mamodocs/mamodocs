# ðŸ“ˆ Variable Rates and Auto-Compounding

## **Your rates will move. Thatâ€™s how it should be.**

The returns you earn with Mamo are _**variable**_ â€” your annual percentage yield (**APY**) shifts with market conditions and will change over time. **More demand for borrowing USDC? Rates go up. Less demand? They adjust down.**

**Think of it like this:** when more people want to borrow USDC, **lenders can charge higher rates**. When thereâ€™s plenty of USDC available and fewer borrowers, **rates adjust down**. Itâ€™s simple **supply and demand** in action across the lending platforms Mamo uses ([**Moonwell**](https://moonwell.fi/) and [**Morpho**](https://morpho.org/)).

**Hereâ€™s what matters:** while the number changes, **youâ€™re always earning the best rate available.** Mamo quietly monitors the top lending opportunities and **moves your funds to wherever theyâ€™ll work hardest** â€” no spreadsheets, no manual tracking needed, and **you stay in control, always.**

### **Understanding what drives your rates.**

**Your earnings depend on real market activity.** When borrowers on Moonwell or Morpho (platforms utilized by Mamo) need USDC for trading or liquidity, rates climb. During quieter periods, they settle lower. Seasonal patterns matter too â€” certain times of year see more activity, which typically means better rates for you.

Mamo gives you transparency without drowning you in data. You'll see your current rate clearly displayed, so you understand what's happening with your money. Learn as you earn, with context that actually helps rather than overwhelming you with crypto speak.

**The key insight:** _Variable doesnâ€™t mean unpredictable._ These shifts reflect **real economic activity**, not random fluctuations, and **Mamo turns them to your advantage.**

### **Compounding for everyone, automatically.**

Every bit of interest and rewards (additional token incentives) you earn gets turned into more **USDC** and added to your balance. More USDC earning interest means more interest next time around. It's one of the most powerful wealth-building tools available, and it happens quietly in the background while you focus on other things.

**Here's how it works:** when your balance earns $10 today, that $10 gets added to your principal. Tomorrow, you're earning interest on your original amount plus that extra $10. The day after, you earn on your original amount plus $10 plus whatever that extra $10 earned. Your money making money, which makes even more money.

When Mamo collects WELL or MORPHO token rewards for you â€“ bonuses from the lending platforms for providing liquidity â€“ they get converted to USDC and folded right back into your earning balance. No manual claiming. No separate reward tokens to track. It just works in the background.

Over weeks and months, this auto-compounding creates meaningful acceleration. A $1,000 balance earning 10% annually becomes $1,100 after one year with simple interest. With daily compounding, it becomes $1,105. That extra $5 might seem small, but scale it up across larger balances and longer timeframes, and the difference becomes substantial.

### **The math that works for you.**

Traditional savings accounts compound monthly or quarterly. Mamo compounds continuously as rewards flow in. Every platform reward, every bit of accrued interest â€“ it all gets reinvested immediately (in the case of rewards, after a minimum of $5 is earned).

This isn't about chasing maximum theoretical returns or complex yield farming strategies. It's about steady wins through smart, human-first routines. Pay yourself first, then let compounding do what it does best over time.

### **Guided, not forgotten.**

This isn't "set it and forget it" â€“ it's smarter than that. You'll always know what's happening with your money through clear updates and easy access to your earnings. Your balance grows, your understanding grows with it.

Mamo keeps you informed without overwhelming you. You'll see when rates change significantly, when compounding adds meaningful amounts to your balance, and how your money's working across different protocols. Calm, steady progress you can actually follow.

Add funds when you can. Your next paycheck, a bonus, money from a side project â€“ any amount works. Then, pause when life gets expensive. Withdraw what you need, when you need it. No lockups, no confusing rules, no penalties for accessing your own money.

### **Built for the many, not the few.**

Traditional wealth management tools require minimum balances, charge high fees, or demand constant attention. Mamo works differently. Whether you're starting with $50 or $5,000, the same smart allocation and auto-compounding benefits apply.

You've got enough on your plate without becoming a full-time financial expert and researcher. Mamo handles the complexity â€“ monitoring platforms, executing optimal moves, managing rewards â€“ so you can focus on the progress. It's your financial companion for growing wealth, designed to work with your life instead of demanding constant attention from it.
