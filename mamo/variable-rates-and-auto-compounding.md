# 📈 Variable Rates and Auto-Compounding

## **Your rates will move. That’s how it should be.**

The returns you earn with Mamo are _**variable.**_ This means the **annual percentage yield (APY)** you see can change over time. Don’t be alarmed by this, it’s a normal part of decentralized lending. On one day you might see, for example, a 10% annual rate, and another day it might show 8% or 12%. These shifts happen because of market conditions (how much demand there is to borrow USDC, how much USDC is available to lend, etc.). Mamo is **transparent** about these changes, and you can always check your current rate. The key thing is, thanks to Mamo’s automatic fund allocation, you’re assured that whatever the rate is, it’s the **best rate currently achievable**, because Mamo has already moved your funds to the optimal spot. In other words, while the absolute number may change, you’re always earning the highest amount possible given the market — Mamo makes sure of that.

Also, remember that **Mamo auto-compounds your profits**. Compounding means earning interest on your interest, and it’s one of the most powerful ways to grow your savings. With Mamo, compounding is happening continuously under the hood. Every time interest accrues or rewards are claimed, they’re turned into more USDC and added to your Mamo account balance. This increases the amount of USDC you have earning interest, which in turn will earn more interest the next go-around. It’s a virtuous cycle: your money makes money, which then makes even more money. And it’s all happening without you having to manually reinvest or even hit a button — Mamo handles everything for you!

If Mamo received some WELL and MORPHO token rewards for you today, it would convert them to USDC and add to your balance, so tomorrow you’re earning interest on a slightly larger pile of USDC. Over weeks and months, this auto-compounding can really add up, helping your balance grow faster than a simple non-compounded interest would.

The beauty of Mamo is that it removes the need for you to micromanage anything. You don’t have to claim rewards, move funds, or worry about changing interest rates. **Mamo has a supportive, “set-and-forget” design:** once you deposit, you can relax and let the system do what it’s designed to do – **maximize your earnings and compound them**. Of course, you’re always in control and can withdraw if you need to, but as long as you keep funds in, Mamo will keep taking care of them.

Mamo has been designed to keep you informed without drowning you in jargon. Mamo is here to make you feel comfortable and confident, knowing that even though 'crypto' and 'onchain finance' can be complex and daunting, **you have a friendly companion in Mamo handling that complexity for you**. 🌱
