# ðŸ“ˆ Variable Rates and Auto-Compounding

## **Your rates will move. Thatâ€™s how it should be.**

The returns you earn with Mamo are variable â€” your annual percentage yield (APY) shifts with market conditions and will change over time. One day it might be 10%, another it could be 8% or 12%.

**Here's what matters:** while the number changes, **you're always earning the best rate available.** Mamo quietly monitors the top lending opportunities across [**Moonwell**](https://moonwell.fi/) and [**Morpho**](https://morpho.org/) and moves your funds to wherever they'll work hardest. No spreadsheets, no manual tracking needed, and you stay in control, always.

Think of it like this: when more people want to borrow USDC for trading or liquidity needs, lenders can charge higher rates. When there's plenty of USDC available and fewer borrowers, rates adjust down. It's simple **supply and demand** in action â€” the same forces that drive all healthy markets.

Your earnings reflect real economic activity happening across these lending platforms. Busier trading periods? Higher rates. Quieter markets? Rates settle lower. What stays constant is Mamo working behind the scenes to ensure your funds are always in the right place at the right time. You get the transparency without the complexity, the optimization without the work.

### **Compounding for everyone, automatically.**

Interest and rewards (additional token incentives) you earn get turned into more USDC and added to your balance. More USDC earning interest means more interest next time around. It's one of the most powerful wealth-building tools available, and it happens quietly in the background while you focus on other things. When your balance earns $10 today, that $10 gets added to your principal. Tomorrow, you're earning interest on your original amount plus that extra $10. Your money making money, which makes even more money.

When Mamo collects WELL or MORPHO token rewards for you (additional tokens from the lending platforms), they get converted to USDC and folded right back into your earning balance. No manual claiming. No separate reward tokens to track. It just works in the background.

Over weeks and months, this auto-compounding creates meaningful acceleration.&#x20;

A $1,000 balance earning 10% annually becomes $1,100 after one year with simple interest. With daily compounding, it becomes $1,105. That extra $5 might seem small, but scale it up across larger balances and longer timeframes, and the difference becomes substantial.

The beauty of Mamo is that it removes the need for you to micromanage anything. You donâ€™t have to claim rewards, move funds, or worry about changing interest rates. Cnce you deposit, you can relax knowing that Mamo will maximize your earnings and compound them, automatically.&#x20;

Add funds when you can. Your next paycheck, a bonus, money from a side project â€“ any amount works. Then, pause when life gets expensive. Withdraw what you need, when you need it. No lockups, no confusing rules. Whether you're starting with $50 or $5,000, the same smart allocation and auto-compounding benefits apply. You've got enough on your plate without becoming a full-time financial expert and researcher. Mamo handles the complexity so you can focus on the progress. ðŸŒ±
