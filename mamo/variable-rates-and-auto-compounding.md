# ðŸ“ˆ Variable Rates and Auto-Compounding

## **Your rates will move. Thatâ€™s how it should be.**

The returns you earn with Mamo are **variable** â€” your annual percentage yield (APY) shifts with market conditions. One day it might be 10%, another it could be 8% or 12%.

While the number may change, **Mamo makes sure that you're always earning the best rate available.** Mamo quietly monitors the top lending opportunities across [**Moonwell**](https://moonwell.fi/) and [**Morpho**](https://morpho.org/) and moves your funds to wherever they'll work hardest. No spreadsheets, no manual tracking needed, and you stay in control, always.

Your earnings reflect real economic activity. When more people want to borrow USDC for trading or liquidity needs, lenders can charge higher rates. When there's plenty of USDC available and fewer borrowers, rates adjust down. It's simple **supply and demand** in action â€” the same forces that drive all healthy markets. What stays constant is Mamo working behind the scenes to ensure your funds are always in the right place at the right time.

### **Compounding for everyone, automatically.**

Interest you earn from borrowers on either Moonwell or Morpho gets automatically added to your balance. More USDC earning interest means more interest next time around. It's one of the most powerful wealth-building tools available, and it happens quietly in the background. When your balance earns $10 today, that $10 gets added to your principal. Tomorrow, you're earning interest on your original amount plus that extra $10. It's your money making money, which makes even more money.

When Mamo collects additional token rewards for you (additional tokens given by lending platforms - for example, WELL or MORPHO), they get converted to USDC and folded right back into your earning balance. No manual claiming. No separate reward tokens to track. It just works in the background.

Over weeks and months, this auto-compounding creates meaningful acceleration.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
A $1,000 balance earning 10% annually becomes $1,100 after one year with simple interest. With daily compounding, it becomes $1,105. That extra $5 might seem small, but scale it up across larger balances and longer timeframes, and the difference becomes substantial.
