# üìä How Mamo Earns You Money

Your money shouldn't just sit there. With Mamo, it quietly grows while you focus on everything else you've got on your plate.

When you add USDC to Mamo, we put it to work through decentralized lending. Your USDC becomes available for others to borrow, and borrowers pay interest for that privilege. That interest becomes your earnings ‚Äî steady, consistent growth that compounds over time.

What is USDC?

[**USDC**](https://www.circle.com/usdc) (USD Coin) is a stablecoin that aims to maintain a 1:1 peg with the US dollar. USDC is issued by [**Circle**](https://www.circle.com/usdc) and is fully backed by US dollars or US dollar equivalents, which include cash and short-dated US government obligations.
{% endhint %}

Beyond borrower interest, the platforms we use often reward lenders with additional incentives ‚Äî like, WELL tokens from [**Moonwell**](https://moonwell.fi/) or MORPHO tokens from [**Morpho**](https://morpho.org/). More tokens, more complexity, right? Wrong. Mamo converts all of those reward tokens into USDC for you automatically. No spreadsheets, no crypto speak, no juggling different assets. You earn the rewards, we handle the conversion, and your USDC balance simply grows. It's compounding for everyone, without the complexity.

### 1. Moonwell: Moonwell USDC Core Market

To understand where Mamo puts your money, let‚Äôs first introduce [**Moonwell**](https://moonwell.fi/). Moonwell is a decentralized lending and borrowing protocol available on networks like [**Base**](https://www.base.org/) **and** [**OP Mainnet**](https://www.optimism.io/)**.** You can think of Moonwell as a crypto equivalent of a lending bank or money market. It allows people to deposit assets (like USDC) into a pool that others can borrow from. If you lend your USDC on Moonwell, you earn interest because borrowers pay fees to use your funds. In fact, Moonwell makes it easy for anyone (even newcomers) to lend assets in these pools and **start earning a variable interest rate** on their digital assets.

The interest rate is ‚Äú**variable**‚Äù because it can change depending on supply and demand ‚Äî when more people want to borrow USDC, the rate will go up, and if there‚Äôs less borrowing, it will come down. Mamo takes advantage of this by always watching where the best rate is.

One great thing about Moonwell is that it‚Äôs designed with security and simplicity in mind, so you can lend **with confidence**. The platform has undergone multiple high quality audits and has been live since 2022. Moonwell takes a safety-first approach to everything, which in turn means the safety for your deposits is a top priority (a comforting thought for beginners!).&#x20;

Moonwell also sweetens the deal for lenders by offering **reward tokens**. Specifically, as mentioned, Moonwell has its own token called **WELL**, and it distributes WELL tokens to users who deposit assets like USDC as an incentive. These rewards effectively boost your overall yield. For example, if the base interest on USDC is, say, 5%, Moonwell might add a couple percent more in WELL token rewards, making your total annual yield higher. Mamo uses Moonwell‚Äôs [**USDC Core Market**](https://moonwell.fi/markets/supply/base/usdc) (the main lending pool for USDC on Moonwell) as one of the primary places to deploy your funds. While your USDC is in Moonwell‚Äôs core market, it‚Äôs earning both the borrower interest and any WELL rewards automatically.

**Why does Mamo use Moonwell?** Because Moonwell provides a reliable, decentralized infrastructure for earning interest, and it has those extra reward incentives. It‚Äôs an engine that‚Äôs constantly generating yield from borrowers. Mamo essentially taps into Moonwell for you. By using Moonwell, Mamo ensures that your money is always working ‚Äì safely and productively. And thanks to Mamo converting the WELL rewards to USDC, you don‚Äôt even have to understand or manage these reward tokens; you just reap the benefits as part of your growing USDC balance.

### 2. Morpho: Moonwell Flagship USDC Vault

Next, let‚Äôs talk about [**Morpho**](https://morpho.org/) and the [**Moonwell** **Flagship USDC Vault**](https://moonwell.fi/vaults/deposit/base/mwusdc) that Mamo can use. If Moonwell is like our ‚Äúengine‚Äù, then Morpho is a special **turbocharger** for that engine. Morpho, like Moonwell, is a decentralized lending protocol that matches lenders with borrowers to earn yield.&#x20;

Moonwell and Morpho joined forces to create the **Moonwell Flagship USDC Vault**. This vault lets you deposit USDC and have it lent out through Morpho. Just like Moonwell‚Äôs USDC Core Market, the vault also generates two kinds of earnings: **interest** and **rewards**. The interest comes from borrowers (just as before ‚Äì borrowers who utilize the funds deposited into the vault pay interest which ends up with the depositors). The extra rewards in the vault‚Äôs case can include Moonwell‚Äôs WELL token and Morpho‚Äôs own **MORPHO** token. Mamo will handle them just like it handles WELL: any MORPHO or other reward tokens earned in the vault will be automatically collected and swapped into more USDC for you. So you get the benefit of these rewards without any hassle.

Morpho is known for its industry-leading security practices and follows a multi-faceted approach to security. It has underggone 27 audits by 12 different security firms ‚Äî so you can be confident that when Mamo moves your funds into this vault, your money remains secure.

**Why does Mamo use this vault?** Because sometimes the **vault can offer a higher yield on USDC than the Moonwell Core Market**. It‚Äôs all about getting you the best return. Mamo will tap into it whenever it makes sense. You don‚Äôt need to worry about the technicalities of Morpho. All you need to know is that it‚Äôs a platform working behind the scenes to potentially earn you more. Mamo takes advantage of Morpho so that _you_ can earn higher yields **without** any extra effort or complexity on your part.

## Summary

Mamo is continuously growing your USDC balance in two ways: **(1)** from borrowers paying interest, and **(2)** from platform reward incentives. Mamo handles all the complexity behind the scenes, so you just see your USDC balance increase gradually as these profits roll in. There‚Äôs no need for any technical know-how or constant monitoring ‚Äî Mamo is working hard in the background to maximize your returns, all while keeping things beginner-friendly and worry-free.

<table data-header-hidden><thead><tr><th width="200.328125"></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Source of Earnings</strong></td><td><strong>How You Earn</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Moonwell Borrower Interest</strong> (Core Market)</td><td>This is the interest paid by people who borrow your USDC in <strong>Moonwell‚Äôs USDC Core Market</strong>. It‚Äôs like earning interest from a traditional savings account, but powered by crypto lending. The rate fluctuates with supply and demand, but you earn this interest in USDC continuously. Mamo collects this interest for you and adds it to your balance automatically.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Moonwell Rewards</strong> (WELL tokens)</td><td>Moonwell often gives out <strong>WELL</strong> tokens as a reward to lenders in the core market. It‚Äôs an <strong>extra incentive</strong> for lending out your USDC on Moonwell. With Mamo, you don‚Äôt need to worry about these tokens ‚Äì whenever Mamo receives <strong>WELL</strong> rewards on your behalf, it will swap them into USDC and reinvest them. These rewards effectively boost your overall earnings without you needing to do anything.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Morpho Borrower Interest</strong> (Vault)</td><td>When your USDC is allocated to the <strong>Moonwell Flagship USDC Vault</strong>, it‚Äôs still being lent out ‚Äì just this time through Morpho. Borrowers who utilize the vault pay interest, and you earn that interest. This is similar to the interest earned via Moonwell's USDC Core Market, just potentially at a higher rate. Mamo will automatically add this interest to your balance.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Morpho (and Other) Rewards</strong> (Vault)</td><td>The <strong>Moonwell Flagship USDC Vault</strong> can also provide <strong>extra rewards</strong> to depositors. These might include <strong>MORPHO and/or WELL tokens.</strong> All such reward tokens earned via the vault are automatically claimed by Mamo and converted into USDC for you, just like the WELL rewards earned through the <strong>Moonwell USDC Core Market</strong>. This means you gain the value of these rewards as pure USDC added to your balance, increasing your returns.</td></tr></tbody></table>



As you can see, **every source of profit ‚Äì whether it‚Äôs interest or tokens ‚Äì ultimately becomes USDC in your account**. Mamo is here to simplify and streamline earnings for you. Rather than having you juggle multiple tokens or manually reinvest your returns, Mamo does it all for you. You just see your USDC stack growing. The table above might sound like a lot of moving parts, but remember: Mamo abstracts this complexity away. To a user, it feels like you deposited USDC and magically earned a competitive interest rate that‚Äôs being auto-reinvested. In reality, behind that magic, Mamo is busy gathering borrower interest from Moonwell or Morpho, plus WELL and/or MORPHO rewards ‚Äì converting everything into USDC and compounding it for you. It‚Äôs a beautiful symphony of earnings, orchestrated by Mamo on your behalf.
