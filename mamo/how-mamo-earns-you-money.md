# ðŸ“Š How Mamo Earns You Money

Your money shouldn't just sit there idle. With Mamo, it quietly **grows in the background**, while you stay focused on everything else on your plate. We put your **USDC** to work through **smart, steady habits** that **compound** over time.

When you add USDC to Mamo, we allocate it across [**Moonwell**](https://moonwell.fi/) and [**Morpho**](https://morpho.org/), two trusted decentralized lending platforms on [**Base**](https://www.base.org/). Your USDC becomes available for others to borrow on these platforms, and then in return, borrowers pay interest for that privilege. That interest becomes your earnings â€” steady, consistent growth that compounds quietly in the background.

What is USDC?

[**USDC**](https://www.circle.com/usdc) (USD Coin) is a stablecoin that aims to maintain a 1:1 peg with the US dollar. USDC is issued by [**Circle**](https://www.circle.com/usdc) and is fully backed by US dollars or US dollar equivalents, which include cash and short-dated US government obligations.
{% endhint %}

In addition to borrower interest, you also earn additional reward tokens when lending through these platforms â€” **WELL tokens from Moonwell, and MORPHO tokens from** **Morpho**. More tokens might sound like more complexity. But with Mamo, itâ€™s simple. Mamo automatically converts all reward tokens into **USDC** for you. No spreadsheets. No juggling different assets. No manual steps. You earn the rewards, Mamo handles the conversion, letting your USDC balance quietly grow. It's compounding for everyone, without the complexity.

### 1. Moonwell: Moonwell USDC Core Market

Mamo uses Moonwellâ€™s [**USDC Core Market**](https://moonwell.fi/markets/supply/base/usdc) on [**Base**](https://www.base.org/) as one of two places where your money can grow. While your funds are in this market, they automatically earn:

* **Borrower interest**
* **WELL token rewards**

No extra steps needed. Just quiet, steady growth.

Moonwell is built with **security** and **simplicity** at its core â€” a natural fit for Mamoâ€™s steady approach. The platform has undergone multiple high-quality **independent audits**, so you can trust that **industry best practices** are followed and your money is in safe hands. Learn [**more**](https://docs.moonwell.fi/moonwell/protocol-information/security).

### 2. Morpho: Moonwell Flagship USDC Vault

The [**Moonwell** **Flagship USDC Vault**](https://moonwell.fi/vaults/deposit/base/mwusdc) is the second place where your money can grow with Mamo.\
Morpho, like Moonwell, is a **decentralized lending protocol**, connecting lenders and borrowers to generate yield.

When Mamo moves your USDC into this vault, it automatically earns:

* **Borrower interest**
* **Extra rewards** in the form of **WELL and MORPHO tokens**

As always, Mamo handles these reward tokens for you â€” automatically converting them into **USDC** so your balance grows without extra effort.

Morpho is known for its **industry-leading security**. It takes a multi-layered approach and has been through **27 independent audits** by **12 different security firms**. You can feel confident your money remains secure when Mamo allocates funds to this vault. Learn [**more**](https://docs.morpho.org/overview/resources/risks/).

**Why does Mamo use this vault?**\
Because sometimes this vault can offer a **higher yield** on USDC than Moonwellâ€™s USDC Core Market.\
Mamoâ€™s job is to quietly move your USDC to wherever it can earn **more** â€” without you needing to watch the markets or make manual adjustments.

Behind the scenes, Mamo takes advantage of trusted platforms like Morpho and Moonwell so your money can do more â€” simply and automatically.
