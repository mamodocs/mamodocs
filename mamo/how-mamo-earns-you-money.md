# ðŸ“Š How Mamo Earns You Money

Your money shouldn't just sit there. With Mamo, it quietly grows while you focus on everything else you've got on your plate. We put your USDC to work through smart, steady habits that compound over time.

When you add USDC to Mamo, we put it to work on [**Moonwell**](https://moonwell.fi/) and [**Morpho**](https://morpho.org/), decentralized lending platforms on [**Base**](https://www.base.org/). Your USDC becomes available for others to borrow on these platforms, and borrowers pay interest for that privilege. That interest becomes your earnings â€” steady, consistent growth that compounds over time.

What is USDC?

[**USDC**](https://www.circle.com/usdc) (USD Coin) is a stablecoin that aims to maintain a 1:1 peg with the US dollar. USDC is issued by [**Circle**](https://www.circle.com/usdc) and is fully backed by US dollars or US dollar equivalents, which include cash and short-dated US government obligations.
{% endhint %}

Beyond borrower interest, you earn additional reward tokens as a lender on those platforms, **WELL tokens from Moonwell or MORPHO tokens from** **Morpho**. More tokens, more complexity, right? Wrong. Mamo converts all of these reward tokens into USDC for you automatically. No spreadsheets or juggling different assets. You earn the rewards, we handle the conversion, and your USDC balance simply grows. It's compounding for everyone, without the complexity.

### 1. Moonwell: Moonwell USDC Core Market

Mamo uses Moonwellâ€™s [**USDC Core Market**](https://moonwell.fi/markets/supply/base/usdc) on [**Base**](https://www.base.org/) as one of two places your money can grow. While your funds are in this market, they earn **borrower interest**, plus **extra WELL token rewards**, automatically. No extra steps needed.

Moonwell is built for **security** and **simplicity**, which makes it a natural fit for Mamoâ€™s steady approach. The platform has undergone several high-quality **independent audits**, so you can be confident that **industry best practices** are followed and your money is in safe hands. Learn [**more**](https://docs.moonwell.fi/moonwell/protocol-information/security).

### 2. Morpho: Moonwell Flagship USDC Vault

The [**Moonwell** **Flagship USDC Vault**](https://moonwell.fi/vaults/deposit/base/mwusdc) is the second place where your money can grow with Mamo.\
Morpho, like Moonwell, is a **decentralized lending protocol** â€” it connects lenders and borrowers to generate yield.

When Mamo moves your USDC into this vault, itâ€™s automatically lent out through Morpho. Just like Moonwellâ€™s USDC Core Market, this vault generates **two kinds of earnings**:

* **Borrower interest** paid by borrowers using the vaultâ€™s funds
* **Extra rewards** in the form of **WELL tokens** from Moonwell and **MORPHO tokens** from Morpho itself

Morpho is known for its **industry-leading security**. It takes a multi-layered approach and has been through **27 independent audits** by **12 different security firms**. That means when Mamo allocates funds to this vault, you can feel confident your money remains secure. Learn [**more**](https://docs.morpho.org/overview/resources/risks/).

**Why does Mamo use this vault?**\
Because sometimes it offers a **higher yield** on USDC than Moonwellâ€™s USDC Core Market. Mamo will quietly move your USDC wherever it can earn more.

<table data-header-hidden><thead><tr><th width="200.328125"></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Source of Earnings</strong></td><td><strong>How You Earn</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Moonwell Borrower Interest</strong> (Core Market)</td><td>This is the interest paid by people who borrow your USDC in <strong>Moonwellâ€™s USDC Core Market</strong>. Itâ€™s like earning interest from a traditional savings account, but powered by crypto lending. The rate fluctuates with supply and demand, but you earn this interest in USDC continuously. Mamo collects this interest for you and adds it to your balance automatically.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Moonwell Rewards</strong> (WELL tokens)</td><td>Moonwell often gives out <strong>WELL</strong> tokens as a reward to lenders in the core market. Itâ€™s an <strong>extra incentive</strong> for lending out your USDC on Moonwell. With Mamo, you donâ€™t need to worry about these tokens â€“ whenever Mamo receives <strong>WELL</strong> rewards on your behalf, it will swap them into USDC and reinvest them. These rewards effectively boost your overall earnings without you needing to do anything.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Morpho Borrower Interest</strong> (Vault)</td><td>When your USDC is allocated to the <strong>Moonwell Flagship USDC Vault</strong>, itâ€™s still being lent out â€“ just this time through Morpho. Borrowers who utilize the vault pay interest, and you earn that interest. This is similar to the interest earned via Moonwell's USDC Core Market, just potentially at a higher rate. Mamo will automatically add this interest to your balance.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Morpho (and Other) Rewards</strong> (Vault)</td><td>The <strong>Moonwell Flagship USDC Vault</strong> can also provide <strong>extra rewards</strong> to depositors. These might include <strong>MORPHO and/or WELL tokens.</strong> All such reward tokens earned via the vault are automatically claimed by Mamo and converted into USDC for you, just like the WELL rewards earned through the <strong>Moonwell USDC Core Market</strong>. This means you gain the value of these rewards as pure USDC added to your balance, increasing your returns.</td></tr></tbody></table>
