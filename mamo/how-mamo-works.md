# üõ†Ô∏è How Mamo Works

Mamo feels simple to use, that's by design. Behind this simplicity is a system that protects your funds, makes smart decisions, and keeps you in control, always.

Mamo is designed to keep your money safe, productive, and always yours. We handle the complexity while you stay informed, watching your money grow through steady wins, not market swings.

<table><thead><tr><th width="237.32421875">Step</th><th>What happens</th><th>Why it matters</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1. Mamo USDC account creation</td><td>A dedicated smart contract is spun up and linked to <strong>your</strong> wallet. </td><td>This is where you will deposit USDC. Direct connection to your wallet means you're always in control. Mamo never takes custody of your funds. Only you can move funds.</td></tr><tr><td>2. Funds get to work</td><td>Mamo allocates USDC to either the <a href="https://moonwell.fi/markets/supply/base/usdc"><strong>Moonwell USDC Core Market</strong></a> or <a href="https://moonwell.fi/vaults/deposit/base/mwusdc"><strong>Moonwell Flagship USDC Vault</strong></a> on <a href="https://www.base.org/"><strong>Base</strong></a>.</td><td>Mamo will allocate your funds to the one currently offering the best interest rate.</td></tr><tr><td>3. Returns roll in</td><td>You can earn interest paid by borrowers of either Moonwell or Morpho (in USDC) + earn additional tokens (WELL, MORPHO).</td><td>Multiple yield streams without extra effort. Mamo quietly collects all earnings.</td></tr><tr><td>4. Smart conversion</td><td>When rewards reach ‚âà $5, Mamo swaps them to USDC via <strong>CowSwap</strong> with prices double-checked by <strong>Chainlink oracles</strong> ‚Äî but only when conditions make sense.</td><td>Fair pricing and no dust-level rewards stuck in your account. No surprises. No unnecessary risks.</td></tr><tr><td>5. Auto-compounding</td><td>Accrued interest and all reward tokens earned are folded back into your Mamo USDC balance.</td><td>Interest on top of interest ‚Äî no manual intervention, no spreadsheets.</td></tr><tr><td>6. Always accessible</td><td>Need your funds? Just withdraw. Withdrawals hit your wallet instantly; even if Mamo is offline, you still control the smart contract.</td><td>No custody risk, no waiting periods. <strong>Add, pause, withdraw ‚Äî anytime.</strong> No confusing rules.</td></tr><tr><td>7. Updates with permission</td><td>If Mamo ships an upgrade, you will get a clear prompt and must agree before anything changes.</td><td>Zero ‚Äúsurprise‚Äù migrations; you stay in charge. You decide what's right for you.</td></tr></tbody></table>
