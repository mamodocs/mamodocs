## Your financial companion, explained

When you start with Mamo, your money stays yours. No common pools. No third-party control.

We create a **personal Mamo account** just for you that connects to trusted platforms like [**Moonwell**](https://moonwell.fi/) and [**Morpho**](https://morpho.org/). It uses smart tools to ensure fair trades and steady progress, handling the complexity while you maintain control.

## How your money grows

### 1. Your personal account begins

Sign up, and Mamo creates your own dedicated account. Think of it as your financial companion that is connected to your wallet, accessible only by you.

* Only you can add, pause, or withdraw
* Direct connection to your wallet means you're always in charge
* Changes happen only when you say so

This is where your quiet growth begins.

### 2. Your money gets to work

With your account ready, you can start building wealth through what we call strategies. One for each asset ‚Äî like USDC ‚Äî where Mamo thoughtfully allocates your funds to platforms chosen for their track record and reliability.

Mamo manages the details. You keep the control.

### 3. Returns accumulate steadily

As your money works, Mamo quietly collects your rewards and directs them back to your strategy. You see everything happening with no manual tracking or guesswork involved.

Calm, steady progress you can watch.

### 4. Smart conversion, fair value

To help your earnings compound, Mamo converts rewards back into your chosen asset (more USDC if that's your strategy), but only when conditions make sense.

* Secure, fair-value trades through **CowSwap**
* Price verification via **Chainlink** oracles to ensure fairness
* No surprises. No unnecessary risks.

### 5. Compound growth, simplified

Your converted rewards flow back into your strategy automatically. Each cycle builds on the last, creating the kind of compounding that used to require spreadsheets and expertise.

Now it just works, in the background.

### 6. Your money, always accessible

Need your funds? Just withdraw.

* Assets and earnings return to your wallet instantly
* No lockups or waiting periods
* Even if Mamo goes offline, you maintain direct access

**Add, pause, withdraw ‚Äî anytime.** No confusing rules.

### 7. Updates with your permission

Sometimes we'll suggest improvements to help your money work better. But nothing changes without you.

* Clear notifications when updates are available
* You decide what's right for you
* Only tested, verified improvements offered

Mamo evolves with you, not without you.
